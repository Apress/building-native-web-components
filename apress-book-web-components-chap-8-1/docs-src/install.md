# Install

`<note-list-component>` is distributed on npm, so you can install it locally or use it via npm CDNs like unpkg.com.

## CDN

npm CDNs like [unpkg.com]() can directly serve files that have been published to npm. This works great for standard JavaScript modules that the browser can load natively.

### HTML
```html
<script type="module" src="http://unpkg.com/apress-book-web-components-note-list/dist/index.js"></script>
```

### JavaScript
```html
import {NoteListComponent} from 'http://unpkg.com/apress-book-web-components-note-list/dist/index.js';
```
